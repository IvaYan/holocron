Reporting Bugs
==============

.. warning::

   Bug reports are hugely important! Before you raise one, though, please
   check `Issue Tracker`_, both open and closed, to confirm that a bug
   hasnâ€™t been reported before. Duplicate bug reports are a huge drain on
   the time of other contributors, and should be avoided as much as possible.

Each time you are about to report a bug please provide as much information
as possible, but keep focusing on things that matters. Usually it'd be
enough to specify the following things:

* Steps to reproduce.
* Expected behaviour.
* Actual behaviour.
* Holocron version.
* Python version.
* Operating System.

Since `Issue Tracker`_ is used not only to track bugs, please do not
forget to attach ``bug`` tag to your report.


Proposing Features
==================

The best way to propose a feature is to file an issue at `Issue Tracker`_
with ``enhancement`` tag. If you want to have a quick feedback on proposal
write it as clear as possible.


Submitting Patches
==================

There are two ways to submit a patch. The first one is by sending a pull
request. It's the preferred way and is recommended for general usage. If
by some reason you don't have a GitHub account, there's another option -
to send a patch via email to project maintainers.

Before you send a patch, please make sure that:

* Your changes are covered by tests.
* ``tox`` run reports success.


Developing Extensions
=====================

Holocron provides a flexible extension system for developers. If you're
a frontend web developer and you have a beautiful site template, please
do not pass by and create a Holocron theme.

On the other hand, if you miss some converter or generator - you can
develop an additional one for Holocron, and share it with others.

Please visit project documentation for details.
