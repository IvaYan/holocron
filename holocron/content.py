    A Page document implementation and representation.

    The Page document is a kind of Holocron's documents that converts some
    markuped text document (e.g. markdown, restructuredtext) into HTML. The
    conversion process is complex and includes both YAML-header parsing and
    searching for valuable information in the content body (e.g. title).

    The resulted HTML will be saved as ``{filename}/index.html``, preserving
    the filesystem structure of the content directory. Here's an example of
    conversion basics:

      ===================  ========================  ==============
          Content Dir             Output Dir              URL
      ===================  ========================  ==============

    A Post document implementation and representation.

    To be honest, a Post document is almost same as Page document. There
    are a lot of common things, that's why the Post inherits the Page.

    Still, we need to separate those two models, because, for instance, only
    posts should be used by feed generator. Looking forward we see many
    similar pitfalls.

    So how the Holocron decides whether it's a post or a page? Simple.
    If a path to the document represents a date - ``/2015/01/04/`` - and
    there's a converter for this document, the document is a post.
