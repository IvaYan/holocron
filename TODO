[x] Check possible issue with parsing document header, similar to
    parsing Markdown's title.
[ ] Commands must be either like regular extensions, or separate kind of.
    Should be moved from holocron.ext namespace for sure.
[ ] Holocron class must support a way to setup a new theme. Consider to
    overwrite *user* theme option. I think it's unnecessary complexity
    to keep a way to have base theme, user theme and extension theme.
    So, extension should: either overwrite user theme or base theme.
    The latest is preferable, i think. 
[ ] Themes should support SASS.
[ ] Posts should not be limited to year/month/day, there should be
    a way to have posts/title format.
[ ] Holocron should support include / exclude additional list.
[ ] Base theme should support twitter cards.
[ ] Base theme should support facebook open graph.
[ ] There should be a deploy command.
